Head over to the [Wiki](https://github.com/AlgorithmicPolicyIndex/ChatPlays/wiki) to read more and specific things about Controls and Settings!


# Work Load / Plans

	- Check to see about removing the pull of ALL previous YouTube messages when restarting ChatPlays in the middle of streaming.
 - OVERALL
	- Helldivers Controls
 	- Github file for game controls
		- Fix the controls JSON
 	- Add BunJS internal function support
 - Electron App
	- Pop-ups - Followers and the like ?
 	- THEMES
 		- Comes default with WinXP! which has a feature missing, but will be added later when I feel like dealing with CSS again.

### Running
> **!** You'll need to edit any thing to match your package manager, I personally use [Bun](https://bun.sh) **!**

Install packages via `bun i` AND install `python` and run `pip install pydirectinput`  
Edit settings mainly stated inside the [wiki settings](https://github.com/AlgorithmicPolicyIndex/ChatPlays/wiki/Settings#main-settings), such as your Channel Name.  
Run `bun run electron`  

There shouldn't be too much issues after that, if there are, feel free to note them in Issues
